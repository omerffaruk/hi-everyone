Hi Everyone!

I would like to dive into programming and GitHub. I am quite new but I have been satisfied with my progress so far. 

HTMLS, CSS and JavaScript are my first objectives to learn. In the meanwhile, I would also like to contact with programmers to gain some insight from them and to make my learning progress  more effective.

With wishes to help each other and enhance our knowledge.
